# Build a Bouqt

## Overview

Build a Bouq is an interactive tool for flower shop owners to use on their website, to help increase engagement and drive sales. Users are able to pick flowers from the stores inventory, and have them displayed visually on screen in the way that they would expect to see them in real person. Users can then add that custom boquet to their shopping cart and checkout.

### Problem

Most flower shop websites are old and outdated, with no real way to see what it is that your ordering. There are usually short descriptions, referencing the colour themes, size and/or a list of flowers that are usually included, but flowers are seasonal and things change. Most flower shop websites will have a photo of a bouquet, but if you've ever ordered flowers for someone, you know that you usually have to wait to recieve a picture from the recipient in order to really know what you bought.

Websites should be interactive to hold attention, and users should be able to make orders effortlessly.  
Store owners should be able to showcase ALL their inventory and having a way to do that is essential.

The more that a customer looks forward to buying your product, the easier it is to sell. The simpler it is to purchase, the more likely it is that it will happen.

People love building things, so this app will showcase the options available and make it efortless to checkout.
